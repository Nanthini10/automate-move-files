# Automate Moving Files

A simple python program to move the files from Downloads folder into appropriate subfolder elsewhere.

It's useful to declutter the Downloads folder and can help save a lot of time.

See the `*_exts` lists to understand what extensions we are interested in and move them to appropriate folders.

You'll need to create the folders in the destination directory. 
### FATAL: it you don't your files will be lost!

### IMPORTANT: Backup with an archive before attempting this!

Packages:
`pip install watchdog`
